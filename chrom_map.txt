" 2-column tab-delimited file for mapping chromosome names
"
" Format
" - Double quotes indicate commented lines.
"   - The choice of using double quotes for comments derives from the set of
"     characters disallowed for reference sequence (i.e., chromosome) names in
"     SAM/BAM files.
" - Empty lines, or lines containing only spaces, are ignored.
" - The first column should match chromosome names in the genome index, while
"   the second column is the desired name of the chromosome to use in processed
"   SAM/BAM files.
"   - Allowed characters for chromosome names follow the SAM v1.6 specification.
"     See https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf
"   - The first column is not allowed to contain repeated chromosome names,
"     but the second column can contain repeated names.
" - The order of chromosomes provided here is maintained in the SAM/BAM file
"   header, and consequently specifies the coordinat sorting order at the
"   reference sequence level.
