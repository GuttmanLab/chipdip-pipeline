# Overview

## Quick Start

This pipeline assumes an existing [conda](https://conda.io) installation and is written as a [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/) workflow. To install Snakemake with conda, run

```
conda env create -f workflow/envs/snakemake.yaml
conda activate snakemake
```

to create and activate a conda environment named `snakemake`. Once all the [input files](#input-files) are ready, run the pipeline locally with

```
# by default, uses the workflow profile workflow/profiles/default
./run_pipeline.sh
```

or on SLURM cluster with

```
./run_pipeline.sh --workflow-profile workflow/profiles/slurm
```

After the pipeline finishes, explore cluster properties in-depth using the cluster quality control Jupyter notebook ([`chipdip_qc.ipynb`](https://github.com/GuttmanLab/chipdip-pipeline/blob/main/chipdip_qc.ipynb)). The conda environment specified by [`workflow/envs/chipdip_qc.yaml`](https://github.com/GuttmanLab/chipdip-pipeline/blob/main/envs/chipdip_qc.yaml) includes all dependencies used by the Jupyter notebook, excluding Jupyter itself. If you already have a Jupyter setup, you can [add this as a new kernel](https://github.com/bentyeh/resources/blob/main/languages/Python.md#installing-multiple-kernels). Otherwise, include the dependency `jupyterlab=4.0.4` to create a Jupyter setup.

Other common usage notes
- `run_pipeline.sh` passes any additional arguments to snakemake.
  - To perform a dry-run: `./run_pipeline.sh --dry-run`
  - To force (re)execution of all rules regardless of past output: `./run_pipeline.sh --forceall`
  - To extend the wait time (in seconds) for snakemake to check for files after rules are completed: `./run_pipeline.sh --latency-wait 30`
    - In distributed computing environments (e.g., on a high performance computing (HPC) cluster), there may be significant latency for files to appear across the shared filesystem, so a high wait time (e.g., 30+ seconds) may be required.
  - (in development) To check for common mistakes and formatting issues of [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml), [`config.txt`](#config-txt), [`format.txt`](#format-txt), and [`chrom_map.txt`](#chrom-map): `./run_pipeline.sh validate`
  - To remove intermediate files generated by the pipeline: `./run_pipeline.sh clean`
- To create a reusable ChIP-DIP pipeline conda environment, run
  ```
  conda env create -f workflow/envs/chipdip.yaml
  ```
  and modify the `conda_env` key in [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) to `"chipdip"`.

To test that the pipeline runs correctly in your compute environment, you can verify that you obtain correct cluster statistics and demultiplexed BAM files from the provided example data. Note that this assumes that you are using the default configuration settings and have the `chipdip` conda environment installed:

```
conda activate chipdip
tests/verify_merged_splitbams_from_example_data.sh results tests/assets
```

Expected output upon successful verification:

```
AB1-A1 matches reference.
AB2-A2 matches reference.
MD5 checksum of cluster_statistics.txt matches reference.
```

<!-- TODO: figures of expected sequences -->

## System Requirements

Hardware: This pipeline was developed to be run on an [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) cluster, but it can also be run locally on a personal computer.
- See benchmarks below for a sense of how hardware requirements scale with dataset size.
- Note: the `chipdip` conda environment itself takes ~2.2 GB disk space, and the unzipped mm10 and hg38 Bowtie 2 indices occupy 3.6 GB and 3.9 GB, respectively. The disk space numbers in the benchmark table below do not account for the size of the conda environment, Bowtie 2 indices, or temporary disk usage during the pipeline run.
- Recommended hardware: 4+ CPU cores, 24+ GB memory, 60 GB free disk space

Operating system: Linux, macOS
- Lack of Windows support is due to our use of the [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel for creating the conda environments described in `workflow/envs/`. [Bioconda currently does not support Windows](https://bioconda.github.io/faqs.html#what-versions-are-supported). However, we have successfully run this pipeline on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
- While Bioconda supports macOS and has built an [extensive repository of packages](https://conda.anaconda.org/bioconda/osx-64/) for x86_64-based Macs (i.e., with Intel processors; conda platform `osx-64`), only a [limited number of packages (or versions of packages) have been built](https://conda.anaconda.org/bioconda/osx-arm64/) for new ARM-based Macs (i.e., with M-series Apple Silicon processors; conda platform `osx-arm64`). Consequently, the versions specified by the environment YAML files described in `workflow/envs/` may not be available on Bioconda for the `osx-arm64` platform.
  - To run this pipeline on an Apple Silicon Mac, we recommend using conda to create an environment targeting the `osx-64` platform, and executing the pipeline programs under [Rosetta translation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment):
    - Create a reusable environment using `conda env create -f workflow/envs/chipdip.yaml --platform osx-64`, and modify the `conda_env` key in [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) to `"chipdip"`.
    - While [macOS should automatically prompt to install Rosetta if needed](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102527), it can also be [manually installed](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/intunecustomersuccess/support-tip-install-rosetta-2-on-new-apple-silicon-m1-macs-to-run-apps-built-for/2087631) using the terminal command `/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta`.

Code interpreters and runtimes: The pipeline relies on scripts written in Java, Bash, Python and has been validated using the following versions:
- Java: 8.0.322 through 11.0.22 (the `workflow/envs/chipdip.yaml` conda environment file currently uses version 8.0.412)
- Bash: 4.2 through 5.2
- Python: 3.9+ (the `workflow/envs/chipdip.yaml` conda environment file currently uses version 3.10)

Packages: Additional required third-party programs and packages are specified in conda environments described in `workflow/envs/`.
- Note: Other recent versions of the same software programs will likely work, but we have not tested all of them. Some specific requirements are discussed below.
  - The version of `deeptools` used (3.5.2) requires a `matplotlib` version between 3.1.0 and 3.7.5, since later versions of matplotlib deprecate some functions used by `deeptools` version 3.5.2. Newer versions of `deeptools` have been updated to support the newer `matplotlib` APIs.
  - NumPy version 2.x is not currently supported.

## Pipeline

Terms

- **split-pool tag**: the individual sequences that are added during a single round of split-pool barcoding (DPM, EVEN, ODD, TERM)
- **split-pool barcode**: the permutation of split-pool tags that uniquely identifies a cluster
- **Antibody ID**: a 9 nt sequence within the antibody oligo that uniquely identifies a type of antibody. In the pipeline, these are identified as a "BPM" tag.
- **cluster**: a set of reads sharing the same split-pool barcode. Antibody oligo reads in the cluster are used to assign genomic DNA reads to specific antibodies.

Workflow

0. Define samples and paths to FASTQ files (`fastq2json.py` or manually generate `samples.json`)
1. Split FASTQ files into chunks for parallel processing
2. Adaptor trimming (Trim Galore!)
3. Barcode identification
4. Split genomic DNA (DPM) and antibody oligo (BPM) reads into separate files
5. Genomic DNA read workflow:
   1. DPM trimming (Cutadapt)
   2. Alignment (Bowtie 2)
   3. Chromosome renaming (e.g., to UCSC chromosome names) and filtering (e.g., removing non-canonical chromosomes)
   4. Masking (bedtools; use ENCODE blacklists)
6. Antibody oligo read workflow:
   1. BPM trimming (Cutadapt)
   2. FASTQ to BAM conversion
7. Cluster generation
8. Cluster assignment and antibody specific BAM file creation
9. Antibody-specific bigWig file creation (deepTools bamCoverage)
10. Summary plots
    1. Genomic DNA and antibody oligo cluster size distributions
    2. Maximum representation oligo ECDFs
11. Summary statistics
    1. MultiQC (trimming, alignments)
    2. Barcode identification efficiency
    3. Cluster statistics
    4. Read assignment statistics

Notes / FAQ
- How are antibody oligo PCR duplicates removed? In step 6.ii above (`fastq_to_bam.py`), oligo UMIs are converted to integers and used as the reference position (column 4) in the BAM file. When clusters are generated in step 7 (during both generation of the split clusters and merged clusters), reads mapped to the same position are deduplicated.
- How are DNA sequence PCR duplicates removed? We assume that DNA molecules from a batch of cells stochastically fragmented in the crosslinking ChIP assay are unlikely to have the exact same start and end positions. Therefore, we consider identical DNA fragments (same start and end positions) in the same cluster to be PCR duplicates. As for the antibody oligo PCR duplicates, when clusters are generated in step 7 (during both generation of the split clusters and merged clusters), reads mapped to the same position are deduplicated.
- The pipeline is non-deterministic, but the output should be functionally equivalent between runs. Specifically, the non-determinism affects the order in which reads are sorted in BAM files (even after running `samtools sort`), and which representative read from a set of PCR duplicates is kept, none of which should affect downstream analyses (e.g., bigWig generation, peak calling, etc.). Non-determinism arises from the following causes of reads being processed in different orders:
  - If `num_chunks` is set to greater than 1 in [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml), then the order in which chunks of reads are processed can change between pipeline runs.
  - If more than 1 processor is available, then Bowtie 2 will align multiple reads in parallel (`-p` option), and the output order is non-deterministic. We do not use the `--reorder` flag to fix the output order for performance reasons.
  - If [`samples.json`](#samples-json) specifies multiple samples, and `merge_sample` is set to `true` in [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml), then the @RG records in the merged BAM file headers will have unique suffixes appended to their IDs. See `samtools merge` [documentation](https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-merge.html).

# Directory Structures

We will refer to 4 directories:

1. <a name="working-directory">**Working directory**</a>: We follow the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project_info/faq.html#how-does-snakemake-interpret-relative-paths) in using the term "working directory" to refer to
   > either the directory in which you have invoked Snakemake or whatever was specified for `--directory` or the `workdir:` directive
   - This is where Snakemake creates a `.snakemake` directory within which it installs conda environments and keeps track of metadata regarding the pipeline (e.g., which steps have finished successfully, which steps failed, and which steps have yet to be run).
   - Rule commands are executed relative to this directory.

2. <a name="workflow-directory">Workflow directory</a>: where the Snakefile and scripts reside
   - `envs/`
   - `scripts/`
   - `profiles/`
     - `<profile_name>/`
       - `config.yaml`: paths are interpreted relative to the [working directory](#working-directory).

     - [`format.txt` / `example_format.txt`](#format-txt)
     - [`samples.json` / `example_samples.json`](#samples-json): paths are interpreted relative to the [working directory](#working-directory)
   - `resources/`
   - `run_pipeline.sh`: the paths in the arguments `--snakefile <path to Snakefile>`, `--profile <path to profile>`, `--workflow-profile <path to workflow profile>`, or `--configfile <path to config.yaml>` are relative to where you run `run_pipeline.sh`

4. <a name="output-directory">Output directory</a>: where to place this directory can be changed in [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) via the `output_dir` key.
   - `alignments/`
   - `alignments_parts/`
   - [`bigwigs/`](#bigwigs)
   - `clusters/`: [cluster file](#cluster-file) and [cluster statistics](#cluster-stats)
   - `clusters_parts/`
   - `fastqs/`: adapter-trimmed reads with identified barcodes appended to the read name

For reproducibility, we recommend keeping the workflow, input, and output directories together. In other words, the complete directory should look like this GitHub repository with an extra output subdirectory (by default, `results/`) created upon running this pipeline.

However, the workflow directory can also be kept separate and used repeatedly on different datasets.
- The [working directory](#working-directory) should stay with the [input directory](#input-directory), so that the `.snakemake` folder containing the Snakemake pipeline metadata is paired with the configuration files.
  - Update paths in [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml)
    - The `scripts_dir` key must point to the workflow scripts directory.
    - Assuming that the above directory structure is followed, the other paths can remain relative paths to configuration files and resource files in the [input directory](#input-directory).
  - Update `run_pipeline.sh`: add `--snakefile <path_to_Snakefile>` and `--workflow-profile <path_to_profile>` arguments to the Snakemake invocation to use the Snakefile and workflow profile from the [workflow directory](#workflow-directory).
  - Run `run_pipeline.sh` from the [input directory](#input-directory).
- To reuse the `chipdip` conda environment, create a discoverable `chipdip` conda environment (e.g., `conda env create -f envs/chipdip.yaml`) and set the `use_existing_conda_env` option in [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) to `true`.
- Example: reuse the workflow and an existing "chipdip" conda environment on a new experiment, submitting jobs to a SLURM cluster
  - [Workflow directory](#workflow-directory) at `/home/workflows/chipdip/`: `envs/`, `scripts/`, `profiles/`, `Snakefile`
  - [Input directory](#input-directory) at `/home/experiments/new/`: `data/`, `config/`, `resources/`, `run_pipeline.sh`
    - `config/config.yaml`: update the following keys as shown
      ```{yaml}
      - conda_env: "chipdip"
      - scripts_dir: "/home/workflows/chipdip/scripts"
      - output_dir: "results"
      ```
    - `run_pipeline.sh`: update the Snakemake invocation as shown
      ```{bash}
      snakemake --snakefile /home/workflows/chipdip/Snakefile --workflow-profile /home/workflows/chipdip/profiles/slurm
      ```
  - Invoke Snakemake from the [input directory](#input-directory) (which is used as the [working directory](#working-directory)).
    ```{bash}
    cd /home/experiments/new/
    conda activate snakemake
    ./run_pipeline.sh
    ```
  - The [output directory](#output-directory") will be `/home/experiments/new/results`.

# Input Files

Documentation for input files in this section is identical to that at `config/README.md`.

## Configuration Files

These files are located under `<input_directory>/config/`.

1. <a name="config-yaml">`config.yaml`</a>: Pipeline configuration - YAML file containing the processing settings and paths of required input files. Paths are specified relative to the [working directory](#working-directory).

     - `bead_umi_length`: integer length of bead oligo UMIs
   - Optional keys: If these keys are omitted from `config.yaml` or set to `null`, then they will take on the default values indicated.
     - `output_dir` (default = `"workup"`): path to create the [output directory](#output-directory) within which all intermediate and output files are placed.
     - `temp_dir` (default = `"/central/scratch"`): path to a temporary directory, such as used by the `-T` option of [GNU sort](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/sort-invocation.html)
     - `barcode_format` (default = `null`): path to [barcode format file](#format-txt) (e.g., `format.txt`). If `null`, no barcode validation is performed.
     - `conda_env` (default = `"envs/chipdip.yaml"`): either a path to a conda environment YAML file ("\*.yml" or "\*.yaml") or the name of an existing conda environment. If the path to a conda environment YAML file, Snakemake will create a new conda environment within the `.snakemake` folder of the [working directory](#working-directory). [*If a relative path is used, the path is interpreted as relative to the Snakefile.*](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#integrated-package-management)
     - `mask` (default = `null`): path to BED file of genomic regions to ignore, such as [ENCODE blacklist regions](#blacklist-bed); reads mapping to these regions are discarded. If `null`, no masking is performed.
     - `path_chrom_map` (default = `null`): path to [chromosome name map file](#chrom-map). If `null`, chromosome renaming and filtering are skipped, and the final BAM and/or bigWig files will use all chromosome names as-is from the Bowtie 2 index.
     - `num_chunks` (default = `2`): integer between 1 and 99 giving the number of chunks to split FASTQ files from each sample into for parallel processing
     - `generate_splitbams` (default = `false`): [boolean value](https://yaml.org/type/bool.html) indicating whether to generate separate BAM files for each antibody target
     - `min_oligos` (default = `2`): integer giving the minimum count of deduplicated antibody oligo reads in a cluster for that cluster to be assigned to the corresponding antibody target; this criteria is intersected (AND) with the `proportion` and `max_size` criteria
     - `proportion` (default = `0.8`): float giving the minimum proportion of deduplicated antibody oligo reads in a cluster for that cluster to be assigned to the corresponding antibody target; this criteria is intersected (AND) with the `min_oligos` and `max_size` criteria
     - `max_size` (default = `10000`): integer giving the maximum count of deduplicated genomic DNA reads in a cluster for that cluster to be to be assigned to the corresponding antibody target; this criteria is intersected (AND) with the `proportion` and `max_size` criteria
     - `merge_samples` (default = `false`): [boolean](https://yaml.org/type/bool.html) indicating whether to merge cluster files and target-specific BAM and bigWig files across samples
     - `binsize` (default = `false`): integer specifying bigWig binsize; set to `false` to skip bigWig generation. Only relevant if generate_splitbams is `true`.
     - `bigwig_normalization` (default = `"None"`): normalization strategy for calculating coverage from reads; passed to the `--normalizeUsing` argument for the `bamCoverage` command from the deepTools suite. As of version 3.5.2, deepTools `bamCoverage` currently supports `RPKM`, `CPM`, `BPM`, `RPGC`, or `None`. Only relevant if bigWig generation is requested (i.e., `generate_splitbams` is `true` and `binsize` is not `false`).
     - `effective_genome_size` (default = `null`): integer specifying effective genome size (see [deepTools documentation](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/feature/effectiveGenomeSize.html) for a definition). If `null`, effective genome size is computed as the number of unmasked sequences in the Bowtie 2 index, after selecting for chromosomes specified in the [chromosome name map file](#chrom-map) and excluding regions specified by the mask file. Only relevant if bigWig generation is requested using normalization strategy `RPGC` (i.e., `generate_splitbams` is `true`, `binsize` is not `false`, and `bigwig_normalization` is `RPGC`).
     - `email` (default = `null`): email to send error notifications to if errors are encountered during the pipeline. If `null`, no emails are sent.
   - Additional notes
     - `null` values can be specified explicitly (e.g., `format: null`) or implicitly (e.g., `format: `).
     - For keys `format`, `mask`, `path_chrom_map`, and `email`, an empty string `""` is treated identically to if the value is `null`.

2. <a name="samples-json">`samples.json`</a>: Samples file - JSON file with the paths of FASTQ files (read1, read2) to process.
   - Required? Yes.
   - [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) key to specify the path to this file: `samples`
   - This can be prepared using `fastq2json.py --fastq_dir <path_to_directory_of_FASTQs>` or manually formatted as follows:

     ```{json}
     {
        "sample1": {
          "R1": [
            "<path_to_data>/sample1_run1_R1.fastq.gz",
            "<path_to_data>/sample1_run2_R1.fastq.gz",
          ],
          "R2": [
            "<path_to_data>/sample1_run1_R2.fastq.gz",
            "<path_to_data>/sample1_run2_R2.fastq.gz",
          ]
        },
        "sample2": {
          "R1": [
            "<path_to_data>/sample2_R1.fastq.gz"
          ],
          "R2": [
            "<path_to_data>/sample2_R2.fastq.gz"
          ]
        },
        ...
     }
     ```

   - Data assumptions:
     - FASTQ files are gzip-compressed.
     - Read names do not contain two consecutive colons (`::`). This is required because the pipeline adds `::` to the end of read names before adding barcode information; the string `::` is used as a delimiter in the pipeline to separate the original read name from the identified barcode.
   - If there are multiple FASTQ files per read orientation per sample (as shown for `sample1` in the example above), the pipeline will concatenate them and process them together as the same sample.
   - Each sample is processed independently, generating independent cluster and BAM files. Statistics used for quality assessment (barcode identification efficiency, cluster statistics, MultiQC report, cluster size distributions, splitbam statistics) are computed independently for each sample but reported together in aggregate files to enable quick quality comparison across samples.
   - The provided sample read files under the `data/` folder were simulated via a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CyjY0fJSiBl4vCz6FGFuT3IZEQR5XYlI). The genomic DNA reads correspond to ChIP-seq peaks on chromosome 19 (mm10) for transcription factors MYC (simulated as corresponding to Antibody ID `BEAD_AB1-A1`) and TCF12 (simulated as corresponding to Antibody ID `BEAD_AB2-A2`).
   - Sample names (the keys of the samples JSON file) cannot contain any periods (`.`). This is enforced to simplify wildcard pattern matching in the Snakefile and to simplify implementation of `workflow/scripts/python/threshold_tag_and_split.py:label_bam_file()`.

3. <a name="config-txt">`config.txt`</a>: Barcode config file - text file containing the sequences of split-pool tags and the expected split-pool barcode structure.
   - Required? Yes.
   - [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) key to specify the path to this file: `barcode_config`
   - Used by: `scripts/java/BarcodeIdentification_v1.2.0.jar` (Snakefile `rule barcode_id`), `scripts/python/fastq_to_bam.py` (Snakefile `rule fastq_to_bam`), and `scripts/python/barcode_identification_efficiency.py` (Snakefile `rule barcode_identification_efficiency`).
     - This file is also parsed in the Snakefile itself to determine the length of the barcode (i.e., the number of rounds of barcoding) and if `generate_splitbams` is set to `true` in [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml), the set of antibody targets for which to generate individual de-multiplexed BAM files (and bigWig file too, if requested).
   - Format: SPRITE configuration file (see our SPRITE [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/GuttmanLab/sprite-pipeline/wiki/1.-Barcode-Identification#configuration-file) or [*Nature Protocols* paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00633-y) for details).
     - Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.
     - An example barcoding configuration file is annotated below:

       ```
       # Barcoding layout for read 1 and read 2
       # - Y represents a terminal tag
       # - ODD, EVEN, and DPM indicate their respective tags
       # - SPACER accounts for the 7-nt sticky ends that allow ligation between tags
       READ1 = DPM
       READ2 = Y|SPACER|ODD|SPACER|EVEN|SPACER|ODD|SPACER|EVEN|SPACER|ODD
       
       # DPM tag sequences formatted as tab-delimited lines
       # 1. Tag category: DPM
       # 2. Tag name: must contain "DPM", such as "DPM<xxx>"; must NOT contain "BEAD"
       #    - Can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens,
       #      i.e., must match the regular expression "[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+"
       # 3. Tag sequence (see resources/dpm96.fasta)
       # 4. Tag error tolerance: acceptable Hamming distance between
       #    expected tag sequence (column 3) and tag sequence in the read
       DPM	DPMBot6_1-A1	TGGGTGTT	0
       DPM	DPMBot6_2-A2	TGACATGT	0
       ...
       
       # Antibody ID sequences formatted as tab-delimited lines
       # - Identical format as for DPM tag sequences, except that Tag name (column 2)
       #   must start with "BEAD_".
       # - Tag sequences must match resources/bpm.fasta
       DPM	BEAD_AB1-A1	GGAACAGTT	0
       DPM	BEAD_AB2-A2	CGCCGAATT	0
       ...
       
       # Split-pool tag sequences: same 4-column tab-delimited format as the
       #   DPM and Antibody ID section above, except that
       #   Tag category (column 1) is now ODD, EVEN, or Y.
       #   Tag name must NOT contain "BEAD" or "DPM".
       EVEN	EvenBot_1-A1	ATACTGCGGCTGACG	2
       EVEN	EvenBot_2-A2	GTAGGTTCTGGAATC	2
       ...
       ODD	OddBot_1-A1	TTCGTGGAATCTAGC	2
       ODD	OddBot_2-A2	CCTGTGCGTTAGAGT	2
       ...
       Y	NYStgBot_1-A1	TATTATGGT	0
       Y	NYStgBot_2-A2	TAGCTACCTT	0
       ...
       ```
   - Notes regarding the entries in `example_config.txt`
     - Names: Each name ends with `#-Well` (for example, `4-A4`) where the `#` gives the row-major index of the tag in a 96-well plate, and `Well` denotes the corresponding row and column.
     - Because only the first 2 antibody IDs are included in the example dataset, the other antibody ID rows are commented out. This prevents generation of empty (0 byte) placeholder files for the other 94 antibody IDs.
     - Sequences
       - The design of a DPM tags allows for 9 bp of unique sequence, but only 8 bp are used in the published SPRITE tag set (in bottom tags, the 9th bp is currently a constant `'T'`). `example_config.txt` therefore only includes the unique 8 bp sequences.
       - The design of EVEN and ODD tags allows for 17 bp of unique sequence, but only 16 bp are used in the published SPRITE tag set (in bottom tags, the 17th bp is currently a constant `'T'`). `example_config.txt` further trims the 1st unique bp from the bottom tag, leaving only the middle 15 bp unique bottom sequence.
       - The design of Y (terminal) tags allows for 9-12 bp of unique sequence.
       <!-- TODO: why are the DPM sequences in the config.txt file trimmed compared to dpm96.fasta? -->

4. <a name="format-txt">`format.txt`</a>: Barcode format file - tab-delimited text file indicating which split-pool barcode tags are valid in which round of split-pool barcoding (i.e., at which positions in the barcoding string).
   - Required? No, but highly recommended.
   - [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) key to specify the path to this file: `barcode_format`
   - Used by: `scripts/python/split_bpm_dpm.py` (Snakefile `rule split_bpm_dpm`)
   - Column 1 indicates the zero-indexed position of the barcode string where a tag can be found.
     - Term barcode tags (Y) are position `0`; the second to last round of barcoding tags are position `1`; etc. A value of `-1` in the position column indicates that the barcode tag was not used in the experiment.
   - Column 2 indicates the name of the tag. This must be the same as the name of the tag in the [barcode config file](#config-txt). If the same tag is used in multiple barcoding rounds, then it should appear multiple times in column 2, but with different values in column 1 indicating which rounds it is used in.

5. <a name="chrom-map">`chrom_map.txt`</a>: Chromosome names map - tab-delimited text file specifying which chromosomes from the Bowtie 2 index to keep and how to rename them (if at all).
   - Required? No, but necessary if using a [blacklist mask](#blacklist-bed) that uses different chromosome names than used in the Bowtie 2 index.
   - [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) key to specify the path to this file: `path_chrom_map`
   - Used by: `scripts/python/rename_and_filter_chr.py` (Snakefile `rule rename_and_filter_chr`, `rule merge_mask`, and `rule effective_genome_size`)
   - Column 1 specifies chromosomes (following naming convention used in the index) to keep.
     - The order of chromosomes provided here is maintained in the SAM/BAM file
       header, and consequently specifies the coordinate sorting order at the
       reference sequence level.
   - Column 2 specifies new chromosome names for the corresponding chromosomes in column 1.
   - The provided `chrom-map.txt` in this repository contains examples for retaining only canonical human or mouse chromosomes (i.e., excluding alternate loci, unlocalized sequences, and unplaced sequences) and renaming them to UCSC chromosome names (i.e., `chr1`, `chr2`, ..., `chrX`, `chrY`, `chrM`) as needed. The header of provided file also includes more detailed documentation about the specific format requirements, such as allowed characters.

## Resource files

These files are located under `<input_directory>/resources/`.

6. <a name="bpm-fasta">`bpm.fasta`</a>: FASTA file containing the sequences of Antibody IDs
   - Required? Yes.
   - [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) key to specify the path to this file: `cutadapt_oligos`
   - Used by: `cutadapt` (Snakefile `rule cutadapt_oligo`)
   - Each sequence should be preceded by `^` to anchor the sequence during cutadapt trimming (see Snakefile `rule cutadapt_oligo`).

7. <a name="dpm-fasta">`dpm96.fasta`</a>: FASTA file containing the sequences of DPM tags
   - Required? Yes.
   - [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) key to specify the path to this file: `cutadapt_dpm`
   - Used by: `cutadapt` (Snakefile `rule cutadapt_dpm`)
   - Each of these sequences are 10 nt long, consisting of a unique 9 nt DPM_Bottom sequences as originally designed for SPRITE (technically, only the first 8 nt are unique, and the 9th sequence is always a `T`), plus a `T` that is complementary to a 3' `A` added to a genomic DNA sequence via dA-tailing.
<!--TODO: for chromatin read 1 - we are trimming the 5' DPM, but are we trimming the 3' DPM if the read extends beyond the DNA insert sequence? -->

8. <a name="blacklist-bed">`blacklist_hg38.bed`, `blacklist_mm10.bed`</a>: blacklisted genomic regions for ChIP-seq data
   - Required? No, but highly recommended.
   - [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) key to specify the path to this file: `mask`
   - Used by: Snakefile `rule merge_mask`, whose output is used by `rule repeat_mask` and `rule effective_genome_size`
   - For human genome release hg38, we use [ENCFF356LFX](https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF356LFX/) from ENCODE. For mouse genome release mm10, we use [mm10-blacklist.v2.bed.gz](https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist/blob/master/lists/mm10-blacklist.v2.bed.gz). These BED files use UCSC chromosome names (e.g., `chr1`, `chr2`, ...). The pipeline performs chromosome name remapping (if specified) before this step.
     - Reference paper: Amemiya HM, Kundaje A, Boyle AP. The ENCODE Blacklist: Identification of Problematic Regions of the Genome. *Sci Rep*. 2019;9(1):9354. doi:[10.1038/s41598-019-45839-z](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45839-z)
     - Example code used to download them into the `resources/` directory:

       ```{bash}
       wget -O - https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF356LFX/@@download/ENCFF356LFX.bed.gz |
           zcat |
           sort -V -k1,3 > "resources/blacklist_hg38.bed"

       wget -O - https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist/raw/master/lists/mm10-blacklist.v2.bed.gz |
           zcat |
           sort -V -k1,3 > "resources/blacklist_mm10.bed"
       ```

9. <a name="index-bt2">`index_mm10/*.bt2`, `index_hg38/*.bt2`</a>: Bowtie 2 genome index
   - Required? Yes.
   - [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml) key to specify the path to the index: `bowtie2_index`
   - Used by: Snakefile `rule bowtie2_align` and `rule effective_genome_size`
   - If you do not have an existing Bowtie 2 index, you can download [pre-built indices](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml) from the Bowtie 2 developers:

     ```{bash}
     # for human primary assembly hg38
     mkdir -p resources/index_hg38
     wget https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/bt/GRCh38_noalt_as.zip
     unzip -j -d resources/index_hg38 GRCh38_noalt_as.zip \*.bt2

     # for mouse primary assembly mm10
     mkdir -p resources/index_mm10
     wget https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/bt/mm10.zip
     unzip -j -d resources/index_mm10 mm10.zip \*.bt2
     ```

     This will create a set of files under `resources/index_hg38` or `resources/index_mm10`. If we want to use the `mm10` genome assembly, for example, the code above will populate `resources/index_mm10` with the following files: `mm10.1.bt2`, `mm10.2.bt2`, `mm10.3.bt2`, `mm10.4.bt2`, `mm10.rev.1.bt2`, `mm10.rev.2.bt2`. The path prefix to this index (as accepted by the `bowtie2 -x <bt2-idx>` argument) is therefore `resources/index_mm10/mm10`, which is set in the configuration file, [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml).

     Note that the pre-built indices linked above use [UCSC chromosome names](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQgenes.html) (`chr1`, `chr2`, ..., `chrX`, `chrY`, `chrM`). If your alignment indices use different chromosome names (e.g., Ensembl chromosome names are `1`, `2`, ..., `X`, `Y`, `MT`), update [`chrom-map.txt`](#chrom-map) such that chromosome names in BAM files are converted to UCSC chromosome names. You can check the names of the reference sequences used to build the index by using the command `bowtie2-inspect -n <bt2-idx>`.

# Workflow profile configuration

These files are located under `<workflow_directory>/profiles/`.

<a name="workflow-profile">`<profile>/config[.vX+].yaml`</a>: Workflow profile config file
  - Required? Yes if running on a compute cluster, such as a [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) environment.
  - The path to this file is specified using the `--workflow-profile` argument to the `snakemake` program -- i.e., in the `run_pipeline.sh` script.
  - [The optional `.vX+` part of the filename denotes the minimum supported Snakemake major version `X`.](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cli.html#profiles)
  - This file specifies the resources available to each rule.
  - Paths are interpreted relative to the [working directory](#working-directory).
  - Two profiles are provided with this workflow. Key options are described below.
    - `default`: for local execution
      - `cores`: maximum number of CPU cores to use in parallel
    - `slurm`: for execution on a SLURM server
      - `jobs`: maximum number of jobs to submit at a time
      - `slurm-logdir`: directory to save SLURM log files; used by the [SLURM executor plugin](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-plugin-catalog/plugins/executor/slurm.html)
        - SLURM standard output and standard error log files are combined into a single log file output to `<slurm-logdir>/<rule>/<wildcards>/<jobid>.log` where `<wildcards>` is an underscore-delimited string of wildcards.
      - `slurm-delete-logfiles-older-than`: SLURM log files will be deleted after this many days; used by the [SLURM executor plugin](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-plugin-catalog/plugins/executor/slurm.html)

# Output Files

These files are generated in the [output directory](#output-directory), which is specified by the `output_dir` key in the [pipeline configuration file](#config-yaml).

1. <a name="bid-efficiency">Barcode identification efficiency</a> (`barcode_identification_efficiency.txt`): A statistical summary of how many tags were found per read and the proportion of reads with a matching tag at each position.
   - The first type of statistic describes how many tags were identified per read. For example, consider a dataset of 10000 adapter-trimmed reads with the expected tag structure as specified in the [`example_config.txt`](https://github.com/GuttmanLab/chipdip-pipeline/blob/main/example_config.txt) file: 1 DPM tag on Read 1, 6 tags (Odd, Even, or Terminal) on Read 2.
     - `170 (1.7%) reads found with 1 tag.` For a small fraction reads, only 1 tag was identified; this is to be expected, whether due to ligation errors, PCR artifacts, or sequencing errors. These reads are output to `fastqs/<sample_name>.part<###>.barcoded_short.fastq.gz` and are not used for analysis.
     - `7500 (75.0%) reads found with 7 tags.` This is the expected result, where all 7 tags are identified in the majority of reads. In the `split_bpm_dpm` rule, these reads are split into `fastqs/<sample_name>.part<###>.barcoded_dpm.fastq.gz` or `fastqs/<sample_name>.part<###>.barcoded_bpm.fastq.gz`, depending on whether a read corresponds to genomic DNA or an antibody oligo.
   - The second type of statistic describes at which positions tags were identified in the reads.
     - `9800 (98.0%) reads found with tag in position 1 (read 1, DPM).` As expected, a DPM-category tag is identified at the start of read 1.
     - `9700 (97.0%) reads found with tag in position 2 (read 2, Y).` As expected, a terminal tag is identified at the start of read 2.

2. <a name="pipeline-counts">Pipeline counts</a> (`pipeline_counts.txt`): A tree-like summary of how many reads remained at each step of the pipeline, produced per aliquot and in aggregate. This can be used to quickly view the proportion of reads corresponding to antibody oligos versus genomic DNA reads; the proportion of properly barcoded reads; etc.
   - The 4 columns of numbers are as follows:
     1. The number of reads remaining after that step
     2. The proportion of reads remaining relative to the immediately previous step of the pipeline
     3. The proportion of reads remaining relative to the read type - antibody oligo (`bpm`) or genomic DNA (`dpm`)
     4. The proportion of reads remaining relative to the starting number of reads.
   - A tabular version is saved to `qc/pipeline_counts.csv`

3. <a name="effective-genome-size-file">Effective genome size file</a> (`effective_genome_size.txt`): Text file with a single value of the computed effective genome size. Only generated if bigWig generation is requested with normalization strategy `RPGC`.

4. <a name="cluster-file">Cluster file</a> (`clusters/<sample>.clusters`): Tab-delimited file, where each line represents a single cluster.
   - The first column is the cluster barcode.
   - The remainder of the line is a list of reads. DNA reads are formatted as `DPM[strand]_chr:start-end`, and antibody oligo reads are formatted as `BPM[]_<AntibodyID>:<UMI>-0`.

5. <a name="cluster-stats">Cluster statistics</a> (`clusters/cluster_statistics.txt`): The number of clusters and antibody oligo (BPM) or genomic DNA (DPM) reads per library.

6. <a name="cluster-sizes">Cluster size distribution</a> (`clusters/[BPM,DPM]_cluster_distribution.pdf`): The proportion of clusters that belong to each size category.

7. <a name="cluster-read-dist">Cluster size read distribution</a> (`clusters/[BPM,DPM]_read_distribution.pdf`): The proportion of reads that belong to clusters of each size category.
   - This can be more useful than the number of clusters since relatively few large clusters can contain many sequencing reads (i.e., a large fraction of the library) while many small clusters will contain few sequencing reads (i.e., a much smaller fraction of the library).

8. <a name="cluster-oligo-prop-ecdf">Maximum representation oligo eCDF</a> (`clusters/Max_representation_ecdf.pdf`): A plot showing the distribution of proportion of antibody oligo (BPM) reads in each cluster that belong to the maximum represented Antibody ID in that cluster.
   - A successful experiment should have an ECDF close to a right angle. Deviations from this indicate that beads contain mixtures of Antibody IDs. Understanding the uniqueness of Antibody ID reads per cluster is important for choosing the thresholding parameter `proportion` for cluster assignment.

9. <a name="cluster-oligo-counts-ecdf">Maximum representation oligo counts ECDF</a> (`clusters/Max_representation_counts.pdf`): A plot showing the distribution of number of antibody oligo (BPM) reads in each cluster that belong to the maximum represented Antibody ID in that cluster.
   - If clusters are nearly unique in Antibody ID composition, then this plot is a surrogate for BPM size distribution. Understanding the number of Antibody ID reads per cluster is important for choosing the thresholding parameters `min_oligo` for cluster assignment.

10. <a name="splitbams">BAM files for individual antibodies</a> (`splitbams/*.bam`)
   - Thresholding criteria (`min_oligos`, `proportion`, `max_size`) for assigning individual clusters to individual antibodies are set in [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml).
   - The "none" BAM file (`<sample>.DNA.merged.labeled_none.bam`) contains DNA reads from clusters without antibody oligo reads.
   - The "ambiguous" BAM file (`<sample>.DNA.merged.labeled_ambiguous.bam`) contains DNA reads from clusters that failed the `proportion` thresholding criteria.
   - The "uncertain" BAM file (`<sample>.DNA.merged.labeled_uncertain.bam`) contains DNA reads from clusters that failed the `min_oligo` thresholding criteria.
   - The "filtered" BAM file (`<sample>.DNA.merged.labeled_filtered.bam`) contains DNA reads from clusters that failed the `max_size` thresholding criteria.

11. <a name="splitbam-stats">Read count summary for individual antibodies</a> (`splitbams/splitbam_statistics.txt`)
    - The number of read counts contained within each individual BAM file assigned to individual antibodies.

12. <a name="bigwigs">BigWig files for individual antibodies</a> (`bigwigs/*.bw`)
    - BigWigs are generated using [`deeptools bamCoverage`](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/bamCoverage.html) with binsize set in [`config.yaml`](#config-yaml). Normalization is performed using effective genome size (`--normalizeUsing RPGC`), which is calculated as the size of chromosomes selected via [`chrom_map.txt`](#chrom-map) minus the size of regions in the [mask](#blacklist-bed) for those chromosomes.

# Additional Resources

Calculator for uniqueness of bead barcodes: [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oebE8hcFLiTMxA7tPD5npYrL4vIQHFr8) (also available as [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/bentyeh/33eb321538f5e5396ca0172785afd733)). This calculator can be used to calculate one of two values:
- Given the number of beads and the number of possible unique barcodes, calculate the proportion of beads expected to be uniquely barcoded.
- Given the number of beads and a desired proportion of beads to be uniquely barcoded, calculate the number of barcodes required.
