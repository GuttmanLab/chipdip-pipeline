#   base (string): (optional) base step to compare the output counts against, if different from the parent step
#   rule (string): (optional) name of the Snakemake rule that produces this step
#   exclude (mapping): (optional) mapping specifying wildcard values to exclude when counting files for this step
#   count_options (string): (optional) arguments to pass to the counting script
#   description (string): (optional) description of this step
#
# Count files are expected to be named {level}[.{wildcard1}.{wildcard2}...].{ext}.count where:

# Note that the cluster_dpm and cluster_bpm levels share the same output BAM file. There are many possible
# implementations for distinguishing gDNA (DPM) reads from bead oligo (BPM) reads:
# 1. Here, we check whether the read type (RT) tag value starts with "DPM" or "BEAD".
# 2. Alternatively, any mapped read should be a DPM read, while any unmapped read should be a bead oligo (BPM) read.
# 3. Alternatively, check for the existence of an RG tag (indicating DPM) vs. a YG tag (indicating BPM).
# 4. Alternatively, check for the existence of an RX tag (indicating BPM).
