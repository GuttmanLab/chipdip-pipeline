# YAML representation of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the pipeline structure.
#
# level: (this is the name displayed in pipeline_counts.txt and referenced by child/parent nodes in this pipeline DAG)
#   parent (string): level of the parent step
#   path (list of string): path pattern (relative to output_dir specified in config.yaml) to match the output files of
#     this step {sample}, {splitid}, {target} are wildcards that will be replaced by actual values
#   base (string): (optional) base step to compare the output counts against, if different from the parent step
#   rule (string): (optional) name of the Snakemake rule that produces this step
#   exclude (mapping): (optional) mapping specifying wildcard values to exclude when counting files for this step
#   count_options (string): (optional) arguments to pass to the counting script
#   description (string): (optional) description of this step
#   count_per_template (int): (optional) number of reads per template represented in the output file (e.g., 2 for
#     paired-end reads in a BAM file); if not specified, defaults to 1.
#
# Count files are expected to be named {level}[.{wildcard1}.{wildcard2}...].{ext}.count where:
# 1. the wildcards are sorted
# 2. {ext} is one of:
#    - fastq-gz: corresponding to a gzip-compressed FASTQ file
#    - bam: corresponding to a BAM file
#
# Tips
# - Avoid counting temporary files (marked by temp() in the Snakefile); otherwise, if the pipeline runs into an error
#   and needs to be restarted, the temp() files may need to be regenerated solely for counting purposes.

# Note that the cluster_dpm and cluster_bpm levels share the same output BAM file. There are many possible
# implementations for distinguishing genomic DNA (DPM) reads from bead oligo (BPM) reads:
# 1. Here, we check whether the read type (RT) tag value starts with "DPM" or "BEAD".
# 2. Alternatively, any mapped read should be a DPM read, while any unmapped read should be a bead oligo (BPM) read.
# 3. Alternatively, check for the existence of an RG tag (indicating DPM) vs. a YG tag (indicating BPM).
# 4. Alternatively, check for the existence of an RX tag (indicating BPM).
